# Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift

This repository is intended to track my progress working through the Winter 2015 edition of Stanford's iTunesU course
['Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift'](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099).

It is intended to support a series of [blog posts](http://www.martinrist.com/tag/cs193p)
exploring my learning journey through the course.  At the end of each lecture / assignment, I'll be tagging this
repository so that I can track how files are changing through the course.
